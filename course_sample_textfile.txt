Learn about acceptable use standards, security practices, password management, and how to protect organizational resources while performing your daily work activities. Lesson 1 Why we have this Policy This lesson introduces the purpose and importance of the IT Acceptable Use Policy. You will learn why clear guidelines are essential for protecting both the organization and its users, and how this policy helps create a safe, fair, and consistent IT environment for everyone. Section 1 Understanding the Policy Purpose This section explains the fundamental reasons behind the IT Acceptable Use Policy and how it supports your ability to perform your role effectively while maintaining security and compliance standards across the organization. The IT Acceptable Use Policy provides clear guidelines for using equipment and services provided by the IT & Digital Services Directorate. These guidelines help you carry out your role safely and effectively while protecting organizational resources. The policy ensures that everyone understands their responsibilities when using IT systems, creating a secure and productive work environment. Example Imagine you receive an email asking you to click a suspicious link. Understanding the Acceptable Use Policy helps you recognize that clicking unknown links could introduce malware, which is prohibited. Instead, you would report the email to IT support, protecting both yourself and the organization. Learning Tip Think of the IT Acceptable Use Policy as your safety guide for the digital workplace. Just as you follow safety procedures in a physical workspace, this policy helps you navigate the digital environment safely and responsibly. Section 2 Ensuring Fair and Consistent Standards This section explores how the policy creates harmonized standards across the organization, ensuring that all users are treated fairly and consistently while maintaining security and operational efficiency for everyone. The policy ensures that standards are harmonized, fair, and consistent across all employees, volunteers, contractors, and temporary staff. This means everyone follows the same rules regardless of their position or department. Consistent standards prevent confusion, reduce security risks, and ensure that all users understand what is expected of them when using IT resources. Learning Tip When everyone follows the same IT usage standards, it creates a culture of accountability and security. If you see a colleague engaging in risky behavior, you can reference the policy as a shared standard that applies to everyone equally. Question True or False — The IT Acceptable Use Policy applies differently to senior managers than to other staff members. Answer False. The policy ensures fair and consistent standards for all users regardless of their role or seniority level. Question Why is it important to have harmonized IT standards across an organization? Answer Harmonized standards prevent confusion, reduce security vulnerabilities, ensure fair treatment of all users, and create a consistent approach to protecting organizational resources and data. Lesson 2 Who this Policy relates to This lesson clarifies who must follow the IT Acceptable Use Policy and what responsibilities come with access to IT systems. You will understand your obligations as a user, the consequences of non-compliance, and why everyone with system access must adhere to these standards. Section 1 Scope of the Policy This section identifies all the different types of users covered by the policy, including employees, volunteers, contractors, and temporary staff. You will learn who is responsible for compliance and why comprehensive coverage is essential for organizational security. The Acceptable Use Policy applies to all employees, volunteers, contractors, and temporary staff who have been supplied access to IET IT services or systems. This comprehensive scope ensures that everyone who can access organizational resources understands their responsibilities and follows the same security standards. Whether you work full-time, part-time, or on a temporary basis, if you have access to IT systems, you must comply with this policy. Question Who is required to follow the IT Acceptable Use Policy? Answer All employees, volunteers, contractors, and temporary staff with access to organizational IT systems must comply with the policy. Example A contractor hired for a three-month project is given access to the organization's project management system. Even though they are not a permanent employee, they must follow all the same IT Acceptable Use Policy requirements as full-time staff, including password security and appropriate use of resources. Learning Tip Remember that access to IT systems comes with responsibility. The moment you receive login credentials or access to any organizational system, you become accountable for following the Acceptable Use Policy, regardless of your employment status. Section 2 User Responsibilities and Compliance This section outlines your contractual obligations to comply with the policy, complete mandatory training, and understand the potential consequences of policy violations. You will learn what is expected of you as a responsible IT system user. All staff are required at all times to comply with the IT Acceptable Use Policy. You are contractually responsible for reading and understanding this policy and completing all mandatory data protection and security training. This is not optional—it is a fundamental requirement of having access to organizational IT systems and resources. Question True or False — Completing mandatory security training is optional if you already have IT experience. Answer False. All users are contractually required to complete mandatory data protection and security training, regardless of their prior experience or knowledge. Learning Tip Treat your compliance obligations seriously. Completing training and reading policies might seem time-consuming, but these activities protect you from accidentally violating rules and help you use systems safely and effectively. Section 3 Consequences of Non-Compliance This section explains what happens when users fail to follow the policy. You will understand the disciplinary processes that may be applied and why enforcement is necessary to maintain security and fairness across the organization. Any staff found to have acted or be acting contrary to this policy may be subject to action under the Disciplinary, Suspension and Appeals Policies. Volunteers found to have acted contrary to this policy may be subject to action under the Disciplinary Regulations. These consequences ensure that policy violations are taken seriously and that all users are held accountable for their actions when using organizational IT resources. Example If an employee repeatedly uses organizational systems for personal commercial activities despite warnings, they could face disciplinary action ranging from formal warnings to suspension or termination, depending on the severity and frequency of the violations. Question What should you do if you accidentally violate the policy? Answer Report the incident immediately to your supervisor or IT support. Being proactive and transparent about accidental violations demonstrates responsibility and allows the organization to address any security concerns quickly. Learning Tip Understanding the consequences of non-compliance is not meant to create fear, but to emphasize the importance of responsible IT use. Most violations can be prevented through awareness, attention, and following the guidelines you learn in this training. Lesson 3 Other Policies, Procedures and Guidelines This lesson introduces the related policies and procedures that work together with the IT Acceptable Use Policy. You will learn how these interconnected documents create a comprehensive framework for security, data protection, and responsible IT use across the organization. Section 1 Security and Data Protection Policies This section covers the key security and data protection policies that complement the Acceptable Use Policy, including Information Security, Data Protection, and Information Classification policies. You will understand how these policies work together to protect sensitive information. Several important policies work alongside the IT Acceptable Use Policy to create a comprehensive security framework. The Information Security Policy establishes overall security standards, the Data Protection Policy ensures compliance with privacy regulations, and the Information Classification Policy and Retention Schedule guide how different types of information should be handled and stored. Together, these policies protect both organizational assets and personal data. Example When handling customer information, you need to follow the Data Protection Policy to ensure privacy compliance, the Information Classification Policy to label the data appropriately as confidential, and the Acceptable Use Policy to access and transmit the data only through approved systems and methods. Learning Tip Think of these policies as layers of protection. Each policy addresses different aspects of security and compliance, and following all of them together creates a strong defense against data breaches, privacy violations, and security incidents. Question True or False — You only need to follow the IT Acceptable Use Policy when using IT systems. Answer False. You must follow multiple related policies including Information Security, Data Protection, and Information Classification policies to ensure comprehensive security and compliance. Section 2 Operational and Risk Management Procedures This section explores operational procedures including Password Guidance, Third Party Due Diligence, Personal Information Risk Management, and workplace safety policies. You will learn how these procedures support secure and compliant IT operations in daily work activities. Important operational procedures include Password Guidance, which sets standards for creating and managing secure passwords, and Third Party Data Protection and Security Due Diligence Risk Procedure, which ensures external partners meet security requirements. The Personal Information Risk Management Procedure helps identify and mitigate risks when handling personal data. Additionally, Display Screen Equipment Assessments and Driving on Company Business policies address physical safety when using IT equipment. Example Before sharing customer data with a new cloud service provider, you must follow the Third Party Data Protection and Security Due Diligence Risk Procedure to verify that the vendor meets security standards. You would also apply the Personal Information Risk Management Procedure to assess and document any risks associated with the data sharing. Question Why is it important to follow Password Guidance when creating passwords? Answer Password Guidance ensures that your passwords are strong enough to resist unauthorized access attempts, protecting both your account and the organizational systems and data you can access through your credentials. Learning Tip Familiarize yourself with where to find these related policies and procedures. When you encounter a situation that requires guidance, knowing which policy to reference will help you make informed, compliant decisions quickly. Section 3 Disciplinary Policies and Appeals This section explains the disciplinary framework that supports policy enforcement, including Disciplinary, Appeals and Suspension Policies and Disciplinary Regulations. You will understand how these policies ensure fair treatment while maintaining accountability for policy compliance. The Disciplinary, Appeals and Suspension Policies and Disciplinary Regulations establish fair processes for addressing policy violations. These policies ensure that any disciplinary action is consistent, proportionate, and includes the right to appeal. Understanding these policies helps you know what to expect if a violation occurs and ensures that everyone is treated fairly according to established procedures. Question True or False — If you receive disciplinary action for a policy violation, you have no right to appeal the decision. Answer False. The Appeals Policy provides a formal process for appealing disciplinary decisions, ensuring fair treatment and the opportunity to present your perspective. Learning Tip The existence of clear disciplinary procedures protects everyone by ensuring consistency and fairness. These policies are not meant to be punitive, but to maintain standards that keep systems secure and users accountable for their actions. Lesson 4 Overview of this Policy This lesson provides a comprehensive overview of the IT Acceptable Use Policy, including organizational ownership of systems, monitoring rights, prohibited activities, and device usage restrictions. You will learn the core principles that govern appropriate use of IT resources and how to exercise good judgment in your daily work. Section 1 System Ownership and Monitoring Rights This section explains the organization's legal ownership of IT systems and its right to monitor usage. You will understand why monitoring is necessary, what can be monitored, and how this oversight protects both the organization and its users while maintaining security and compliance. The organization is the legal owner of all systems and services provided to you for carrying out your duties. The organization retains the right to monitor and view usage, access, unencrypted and encrypted content, and any files created, stored, sent, or received using any organizational system. This monitoring is undertaken for legitimate purposes including security, regulatory or legal compliance, maintenance, and disciplinary purposes. Example If security systems detect unusual file transfer activity from your account at 3 AM, IT security may review your account activity to determine if your credentials have been compromised. This monitoring helps protect you and the organization from security breaches and data theft. Question True or False — Encrypting files on organizational systems prevents the organization from accessing them if necessary for security or compliance purposes. Answer False. The organization retains the right to access both unencrypted and encrypted content on its systems when required for legitimate purposes such as security investigations or legal compliance. Learning Tip Understanding that systems are monitored should guide your behavior. Use organizational systems as if your supervisor could review your activity at any time, because in some circumstances, they may need to do exactly that for legitimate business or security reasons. Section 2 Prohibited Activities and Appropriate Use This section details specific activities that are prohibited when using organizational IT resources. You will learn about unauthorized access, malware introduction, regulatory violations, copyright infringement, inappropriate content, excessive personal use, and unauthorized commercial activities, along with practical examples of each. All staff are responsible for exercising good judgment regarding appropriate use of organizational resources. Resources may not be used for any unlawful or prohibited purpose. Prohibited activities include accessing systems for which you are not authorized, causing intentional disruption or introducing viruses or malware, breaching statutory or regulatory requirements such as UK GDPR or Computer Misuse Act, and violating copyright law or international technology embargoes. Example You receive an email with a link to download free software that claims to improve your productivity. Even if the software seems useful, downloading and installing unauthorized software could introduce malware, violate licensing agreements, and create security vulnerabilities. Always request software through official IT channels. Additional prohibited activities include publishing information or content of a defamatory, bullying, sexually explicit nature, or content that is likely to incite racial hatred or damage the organization's reputation; excessive use for non-work related activities; and engaging in commercial activities that do not relate to organizational business. Question What should you do if you accidentally access a system or file you are not authorized to view? Answer Exit immediately, do not view or copy any information, and report the incident to your supervisor or IT support. Accidental access should be disclosed promptly to demonstrate that it was unintentional. Learning Tip When in doubt about whether an activity is appropriate, ask yourself Is this necessary for my work? Could this harm the organization or others? Would I be comfortable if my manager saw this activity? If you have any doubts, consult with your supervisor or IT support before proceeding. Section 3 Personal Device Restrictions and Supplementary Policies This section covers the prohibition on using personal devices to access organizational systems and explains why approved equipment is required. You will also learn about supplementary acceptable use policies from external systems and services you may use in your work. The use of personal devices including mobile phones, tablets, laptops, smart speakers, and similar devices to access organizational systems is prohibited. Access to organizational systems should only be undertaken using approved equipment, unless operating under an approved exception. This restriction protects organizational data from security risks associated with unmanaged personal devices that may lack proper security controls, updates, or monitoring. Example You are working from home and want to check your work email on your personal smartphone for convenience. However, this violates the policy unless your personal device has been specifically approved and configured with required security controls through an official exception process managed by IT. Question True or False — If you need to access organizational systems from a personal device, you should first request an approved exception through IT. Answer True. While personal device use is generally prohibited, approved exceptions can be granted through proper channels, ensuring that necessary security controls are implemented before access is allowed. Other systems or services that you may use during the course of your work may employ their own Acceptable Use Policies which must be adhered to and taken as supplementary to this policy. For example, cloud services, partner systems, or industry-specific platforms may have additional usage requirements that you must follow in addition to the organizational policy. Learning Tip When you begin using a new external system or service for work, take time to review its acceptable use policy. Understanding these supplementary requirements helps you avoid violations and ensures you use all work-related systems appropriately and securely. Lesson 5 Service Access and Password/Account Management This lesson covers essential practices for managing system access, passwords, and account security. You will learn how to request appropriate access levels, protect your credentials, create strong passwords, lock your workstation, and respond to security incidents involving your account. Section 1 Requesting and Managing System Access This section explains how system access is granted based on your role, how to request additional access when needed, and why access is limited to only what is necessary for your work. You will understand the principle of least privilege and the authorization process. Staff are provided with access to organizational systems that are relevant to their role. If you require access to additional systems, raise an IT Service Centre ticket outlining the reason for the access. Authorization will be sought from your line manager and the owner of the system before access is granted. Where varying levels of access to systems are available, you will only be provided with the level necessary and relevant to your role. Example You join a new project team that uses a specialized project management system you have not accessed before. To gain access, you submit an IT Service Centre ticket explaining your role on the project. IT will verify your need with your manager and the system owner, then grant you the appropriate level of access—perhaps team member access rather than administrator access. Question Why are you only given the minimum level of access necessary for your role? Answer This principle of least privilege reduces security risks by limiting the potential damage from compromised accounts, accidental errors, or insider threats. It ensures that users can only access and modify information directly relevant to their responsibilities. Learning Tip If your role changes or you join new projects, proactively review your system access needs. Request new access through proper channels and also notify IT if you no longer need access to certain systems, helping maintain security and proper access management. Section 2 Account Security and Workstation Locking This section emphasizes your accountability for actions taken with your login credentials and the critical importance of locking your computer when away from your desk. You will learn practical habits to prevent unauthorized access to organizational systems and data. Staff are accountable for actions completed using their login credentials. Your computer must be locked whenever you are away from your desk to help prevent unauthorized access to organizational systems and data. This simple action is one of the most effective security controls you can implement daily. Locking your workstation takes only seconds but prevents others from accessing systems, reading emails, or viewing confidential information using your credentials. Example You step away from your desk for a quick coffee break, leaving your computer unlocked. A colleague passing by could accidentally see confidential salary information displayed on your screen, or worse, someone with malicious intent could access sensitive systems or send emails appearing to come from you. Locking your workstation prevents these scenarios. Question True or False — You are responsible for any actions taken using your login credentials, even if someone else used your unlocked computer. Answer True. You are accountable for all actions completed with your credentials, which is why it is critical to lock your workstation and protect your passwords at all times. Learning Tip Make locking your workstation an automatic habit. On Windows, press Windows key + L. On Mac, press Control + Command + Q. Practice this keyboard shortcut until it becomes second nature every time you stand up from your desk, even for just a moment. Section 3 Password Creation and Confidentiality This section covers the requirements for creating strong passwords, keeping them confidential, and never sharing them with anyone. You will learn why password sharing is unacceptable even in seemingly convenient situations and how to maintain password security in all circumstances. Staff are responsible for creating, keeping confidential, and using appropriate passwords for accessing organizational systems and services. Passwords must meet the criteria set out in the Password Guidance document. Never share a password with anyone, including managers, directors, system administrators, personal assistants, or colleagues. All passwords are to be treated as confidential organizational information. It is unacceptable to provide your password to a colleague who is covering your work during holidays and other absences. No one should ever ask you for, nor should you ever divulge, your passwords. If someone needs to perform tasks on your behalf during your absence, proper delegation mechanisms or shared accounts with appropriate authorization should be used instead of sharing personal credentials. Example You are going on vacation and a colleague will handle your responsibilities. Instead of giving them your password to access your files, work with your manager and IT to set up proper file sharing permissions or temporary delegation of specific tasks. This maintains security and accountability while ensuring work continuity. Question What should you do if your manager asks for your password to access a file while you are out of the office? Answer Politely explain that password sharing is against policy and offer alternative solutions such as sharing the specific file through approved methods, setting up delegation, or having IT assist with proper access arrangements. Learning Tip Create strong, unique passwords using a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Consider using passphrases—longer combinations of words that are easier to remember but difficult to guess. Never reuse passwords across different systems, especially between work and personal accounts. Section 4 Responding to Compromised Credentials This section explains what to do if you suspect your password or login has been compromised. You will learn the immediate steps to take, why rapid response is critical, and how to report security incidents to minimize potential damage to organizational systems and data. If you suspect that your login or any password has been compromised, you must change your password immediately and report this to the IT Service Centre without delay. Rapid response to potential credential compromise is critical to preventing unauthorized access, data breaches, and other security incidents. Even if you are not certain that compromise has occurred, it is better to report your suspicions and take preventive action. Example You notice emails in your sent folder that you did not send, or you receive a password reset notification that you did not request. These are signs that your account may be compromised. Immediately change your password, notify the IT Service Centre, and check for any other suspicious activity. IT can investigate and take additional protective measures such as reviewing access logs and checking for unauthorized changes. Question What are some signs that your account may have been compromised? Answer Signs include unexpected password reset notifications, emails you did not send, unfamiliar login locations or times in activity logs, files you did not create or modify, system access you did not perform, or colleagues receiving suspicious messages from your account. Question True or False — If you are not sure whether your password was compromised, you should wait to see if anything else suspicious happens before reporting it. Answer False. If you suspect compromise, report it immediately even if you are uncertain. Early reporting allows IT to investigate and take preventive measures before any damage occurs. Learning Tip Keep the IT Service Centre contact information readily available so you can report security incidents quickly. Save the number in your phone and bookmark the service portal. In security incidents, every minute counts, and knowing how to reach IT support immediately can significantly reduce potential damage.'''
